Title: Custom Annotations to Console Outputs
Version: 0.2.1
Author: Maksim Rudnev
Maintainer: Maksim Rudnev <maksim.rudnev@gmail.com>
Description: Extend console output with a custom text, so that it is more comprehensible for newbies; make these annotations dependent on the input calls and the objects produced by the calls; print additional summaries without interfering with print methods. The package currently includes two functions: 'create_annotation()' for creating libraries of (conditional) annotations, and 'annotated()' to apply these libraries and get annotated console output.
